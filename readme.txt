TEI

Text Encoding Initiative

A very much in-progress corpus of novels and short stories set in Madrid, encoded using TEI. Have a look at OBRATDS-TEI.xml to see how I'm encoding placenames, unnamed places, demonyms, spatial function words, foreign termns, heterotopias and other allusions to mappable spatial information.
